Sections
--------

Welcome to *Lunar Killer*! The game has three main sections:


### Start screen

After the introduction, the player can interact with the main menu through mouse clicks.
The three existing buttons are:

| Button  | Description                                 |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| START   | Starts the game, going to the battle screen |
| CREDITS | Shows the dream team that made this game    |
| QUIT    | Leaves the game                             |


### Battle screen

The epic battle has begun! You must shoot Dr. Stone down while avoiding the stones he
throws at you.

| Key           | Description                   |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| W             | Moves Hervog forward          |
| A             | Moves Hervog to the left      |
| S             | Moves Hervog backwards        |
| D             | Moves Hervog to the right     |
| Space (press) | Fires a normal shot           |
| Space (hold)  | Fires a powerful charged shot |

Careful with the charged shot, though: this special skill has a cooldown until it can
be used again.


### Score screen

This screen shows how well you've fared in your battle!

First of all, a **rank** is shown according to your score. Rumors say there are more
than 10 ranks in all...

Secondly, if your score is high enough, you may be prompted to write your name to
enter the hall of fame! The name you enter must have a *maximum* of 8 characters,
though, or it will be truncated.

Finally, the game's local hall of fame is shown, and the player returns to the start
screen.
